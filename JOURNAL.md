Gotta start the work on the board today, will do this IN SCHOOl with the schematic.

umm okay, we are trying to make a subesat and i am incharge of making the RF board, and i have thought of using the CC1125 by Texas Instruments(my fav semiconductor manufacturer).

it is a great IC tbh and i would adapt the openlst rf design i think, because i like openlst too!

and another goal i have, to make this board as good-looking as possible.


and umm yeah, i thought let's also add the RP2040, arguably the greatest MCU ever made for it's cost. i think i might even just use the RP2350A, but i am more familiar with RP2040 so idk what am i gonna choose, i am going with rp2350A for now.

yeah, i am following the cc1125 design guide right now, and i am gonna probably complete the circuit for the cc1125 today itself.

okay yup, i worked a bit today, i think the schematic for cc1125 is complete, here is the work i did:
